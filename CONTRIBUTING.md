# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## Bugs, feature requests, feedback, and general discussions?
Start a discussion on the [repository issue tracker](https://github.com/modernuo/modernuo/issues).

## Reporting security issues and bugs
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to hi@modernuo.com.
You should receive a response within 24 hours.
If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Other discussions
Our team members also monitor several other discussion forums:

* [ModernUO Discord](https://discord.gg/NUhe7Pq9gF)
* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/modernuo)
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/modernuo)

## Contributing code and content

We accept fixes and features! Here are some resources to help you get started on how to contribute code or new content.

* ["Help wanted" issues](https://github.com/modernuo/modernuo/labels/help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs. Comment on an issue if you want to create a fix.

### Submitting a pull request

If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests. Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions.

1. Ensure all files have the appropriate [LICENSE](/LICENSE) header (Line 634-649)
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed.
1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new build process,
   configurations, environment variables, dependencies, etc.
1. Increase the version numbers to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
   The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
1. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
